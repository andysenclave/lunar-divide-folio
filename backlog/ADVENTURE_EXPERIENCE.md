## Chennai | 2013–2015 | *The Beginning*

### Kotivakkam Sunsets

After long days of training and early career hustle at Cognizant, Kotivakkam Beach in Perungudi became the escape. Not the tourist-packed Marina, but this quieter stretch where the Bay of Bengal met the edge of the city. Watching sunsets there became a ritual — a way to decompress from the intensity of breaking into tech.

### Pondicherry Weekends

Weekend getaways to Pondicherry with friends — no agenda, just the French Quarter's lazy cafes, beach parties, and the occasional concert by the water. The kind of trips where you return more tired than when you left, but somehow recharged.

---

## Kolkata & The Himalayas | 2015–2016 | *First Peaks*

### Gurudongmar Lake — 17,800 Feet

Nathang Valley and Gurudongmar Lake with office colleagues. At nearly 18,000 feet, where the air thins and the landscape feels lunar, you learn what your body can handle. No altitude sickness — just the quiet triumph of standing at one of the highest lakes in the world.

### Bali Pass — 20 Minutes in an Avalanche

Twelve days. Kolkata to Delhi by train, then cabs winding into Uttarakhand with a group of avid trekkers. Bali Pass at 16,000 feet is no beginner's trail. And then it happened — caught in an avalanche during the ascent. Twenty minutes of not knowing. The mountain teaching respect the hard way. The most daring and treacherous thing I've ever done. And I'd do it again.

---

## Norway | 2016–2019 | *The Scandinavian Chapter*

### First Impressions

First time in Europe. Years of Hollywood movies and sitcoms had painted a picture, but the reality was different in unexpected ways. The quiet. The systems that just *worked*. The pleasant hum of a society that had figured certain things out. Less noise — in every sense.

### Sognefjord

Cruising through Sognefjord — Norway's longest and deepest fjord. Waterfalls dropping from impossible heights, villages clinging to cliffsides, and that particular Nordic light that makes everything look like a painting you'd never believe was real.

### Hemsedal — 15,000 Feet of Freefall

Tandem skydiving over Hemsedal. Standing at the edge of the plane, looking down at Norwegian mountains, and then jumping. The best experience of my life. It's not about conquering fear — it's about proving your body is always there for you. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

### Europe Unlocked — 2017

With Norway as a base, Europe opened up. Brussels, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Paris, Luxembourg — sometimes with friends, sometimes with colleagues, sometimes alone. Each city a different rhythm. The freedom of a weekend train and no fixed plans.

### Sweden & Copenhagen — 2018

Ferry from Sweden to Copenhagen with friends. And yes, the casino. Won a ridiculous amount of money. Lost it all immediately after — greed and idiocy in equal measure. But it was never about the money. It was about the laughter, the stories, and the lesson that the house always wins.

## Berlin | 2019–2021 | *The Startup Years*

### Why Berlin

Offers came from Rotterdam (a VR company), Hamburg (MyTaxi, before the rebrand), and FinCompare in Berlin. Berlin won — more opportunities, lower cost of living, better salary, and a team interaction that just clicked. The startup energy was exactly what I was looking for: the chance to understand why ideas succeed, and why they fail.

### Krakow Offsite — The Best Week

Five days in Krakow with the FinCompare team. Mornings were work — ideation sessions, planning, gap analysis, breakfast meetings from 8 to 11. But afternoons? Rowing competitions on the river. Surfing. Football. Flying kites on the seashore. Evenings brought themed parties and the kind of bonding that turns colleagues into close friends. One of the best weeks of my life.

### Munich — Oktoberfest & Bayern

Munich with friends for Oktoberfest and a Bayern Munich match. The combination of beer, football, and the Bavarian atmosphere is hard to beat.

### Amsterdam — A Month of Remote Work

2021, as lockdowns lifted. Amsterdam for a month, working remotely with colleagues. Cafes by the canals. Parks and gardens. A city designed for walking. Strict restrictions still in place, but Amsterdam found a way to stay alive — and so did we. Morning espressos, afternoon work sessions, evening strolls through a city that felt like it was exhaling after holding its breath.

---

## Kolkata | 2021–Present | *The Return & The Road*

### Lockdown Focus

Returned to India between lockdowns. COVID restrictions were still in force, so travel took a backseat. The focus shifted to building Localoi — late nights, product decisions, the grind of making a startup happen from scratch.

### The Driving Chapter

Once things settled at Nous, a new hobby emerged: driving. Bought a car and discovered the freedom of the open road. Weekend escapes became the norm — not flights and visas, but highways and pit stops.

### Road Trips Across Eastern India

The car became a portal:
- **Purulia** — red laterite landscapes and Chhau dance country
- **Puri, Odisha** — the Jagannath Temple, Konark, and endless coastline
- **Bolpur, Shantiniketan** — Tagore's land, baul music, and quiet afternoons
- **Asansol, Durgapur** — industrial heartland with unexpected beauty
- **Jharkhand** — forests, waterfalls, and roads less travelled

### Back to the Mountains

Multiple trips to Kalimpong, Sikkim, and Darjeeling. The Himalayas never get old. This time with friends, in my own car, on my own terms. The roads winding up, the tea gardens rolling by, and the peaks emerging from the clouds.

### Andy's Enclave — The Content Journey

Started documenting. YouTube vlogs, shorts, content capturing these road trips and mountain escapes. Andy's Enclave became the outlet — a place where the adventure side has a voice. Still building it, still filming, still creating alongside the day job and upskilling.

## Adventure Philosophy

> "It's not about conquering fear — it's about proving your body is always there for you."

The adventure side isn't separate from the engineering side. Both are about exploration — one through code, one through roads and mountains. Both require preparation, risk assessment, and the willingness to push into the unknown.
